# Reddit submissions and tweets analysis during "GameStop Saga"
This repository contains the exam project of the "Data Management" course at the University of Milano-Bicocca.
The 'scripts' folder contains the Python code.

The purpose of this project is to analyze whether the social networks Reddit and Twitter have really influenced GameStop's short squeeze.
The interest is to look for some relationship between the different submissions made on the r/WallStreetBets page by users and the fluctuation of the GME share price, and some other link between the various tweets, of reference persons or not, and the same increase in the shares of the famous American video game retailer.
Through the construction of a graph database, we want to reconstruct the social network of users (reddit on the one hand, twitter on the other) who actively participated, through comments and personal opinions posted on the reference social networks, in the short squeeze of GameStop. The aim is therefore also to identify the social relationships between the various users, highlighting the relevant ones, thus finding those people (retail investors) who had the greatest influence in the great event described.

The project was carried out together with colleagues Francesco Gregori and Francesco Oliviero.
